# ML_DataPreprocessing
- Data preprocessing is the crucial step in making a ML model. 
- If there is no data preprocessing step on the data, your ML model won't work properly

### Pre-processing steps to do to prepare any dataset on which we will machine learning model

1. **Get the dataset** <br><br>
    The first step is always to get the dataset and try to understand dataset. Try to figure out what all are independent variables and       what are dependent variables.In ML, some independent variables are used to predict a depedent variable.
    
    - The name of the dataset I have taken is 'Data.csv'.
    - Dataset contains four columns -> Country, Age, Salary, Purchased. Dataset has total 10 observations.
    - Dataset contains information of customers of some company and first three columns are information of a customer like country, age,         salary and fourth column tells if the customer has purchased the product of the company or not.
    - In Data.csv, first three columns i.e. *Country, Age, Salary* are independent variables and fourth column *Purchased* is an          indepedent        variable
